# Monte Carlo Pricing and Risk-Neutral Derivatives Framework  

## Overview  
This project implements the **Monte Carlo method** for pricing financial derivatives, incorporating advanced probability models, the Feynman-Kac theorem, and martingale pricing theory. It covers various options pricing techniques, Greek computations, and error-reduction methods to provide accurate and robust derivative valuations.
